There are some jagged edges in terms of abandoned/non-functional code, but on the whole, this is a well-formed basic Express app. For a user's perspective, I would have liked to see more cohesion and interaction among the components of your app. The integration of the weather and maps APIs are technically impressive, but feel very isolated from the user profile and the notes. I was impressed by your workflow, both in terms of version control and in terms of division of labor. I look forward to hearing how *you* think the group collaboration went.
