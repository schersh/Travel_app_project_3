WDI Project 3 Travel App

This single-page travel app will integrate information from third-party APIs to provide users with up-to-date travel information for major cities and destinations to improve their travel experience. As a user I can search for a city, view its location on a map and then view information on weather, events, restuarants, and attractions. Users may search the app without logging in, but registered users will have the additional option to create a profile, save their favorite cities and add photos and notes to each favorited city so that they can access the information for planning future trips.
